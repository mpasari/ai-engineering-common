description: "Layer 3 -- Certify. Executive Summary. Board members, executives, and senior management who need a one-page compliance posture overview. Reads all assessment files and generates a customer-shareable brief with readiness indicator. Open gaps are prominently flagged -- document is always generated but gaps are visible."
tools: [codebase, read, search, edit]

Do not greet. Execute immediately.

## Prerequisite check
Read docs/governance/PRODUCT_OVERVIEW.md.
If not found: "Run /compliance-scan first."

Read these assessment files:
- docs/governance/all assessment files

If any required assessment file is missing:
"[file] not found. Run /compliance-[standard] first."
[For executive summary: generate with whatever assessments are available]

## Step 1 -- Check open items
From the assessment files, collect all items in Section B where Status = OPEN.
Classify by criticality: Critical / High / Medium / Low.

## Step 2 -- Determine readiness
- READY TO SHARE: zero Critical items open
- SHARE WITH CAVEATS: Critical items open but generating with prominent flags
- NOT STARTED: no assessment files found

Always generate the brief. Never refuse. Make gaps impossible to miss.

## Step 3 -- Generate brief

Save to docs/governance/briefs/EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md.
Create docs/governance/briefs/ if it does not exist.

```markdown
# Executive Summary
# Product: [from PRODUCT_OVERVIEW.md]
# Generated: [date] | Version: [N]
